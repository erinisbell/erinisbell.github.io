I've been told that learning to program is something that teenagers do and not adults.

I don't have salt water, but do have a lot of sweat and tears involved in learning something
I've never done before. There is a new challenge every day, and the feeling you get once
a concept starts to make sense is extremely rewarding. I'm completely outside of my comfort zone,
but I'm enjoying each day with its new set of challenges and looking forward to what the
future has to bring.
